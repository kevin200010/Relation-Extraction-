A fine-tuning pipeline for training BERT-based models on a text classification task is implemented using PyTorch. Two pre-trained BERT models, 'bert-base-uncased' and 'bert-large-uncased', are employed, and their corresponding tokenizers are utilized to process and tokenize the training, validation, and test datasets. The training loop involves the use of the AdamW optimizer with specified hyperparameters, such as a learning rate of 2e-5 and weight decay of 5e-3. The training process occurs over five epochs, with each epoch displaying the average training loss. The code efficiently organizes data using DataLoader instances and ensures proper gradient clipping during model training.
